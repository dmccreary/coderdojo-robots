# Lesson Plan: Collision Avoidance Robots for 5-Year-Olds

## Subject: Science

## Grade Level: 5

## Topic: Collision Avoidance Robots

## Learning Objectives:

* Students will be able to define what a collision avoidance robot is.
* Students will be able to identify the different parts of a collision avoidance robot.
* Students will be able to explain how a collision avoidance robot works.
* Students will be able to create their own collision avoidance robot.

## Materials:

* Collision avoidance robots (one for each student)
* AAA batteries (four for each robot)
* Wires
* Tape
* Magnifying glasses
* Markers
* Paper

## Procedure:

1. Begin by asking students what they know about robots. What are robots used for? Where do they see robots?
2. Show students the collision avoidance robots. Have them identify the different parts of the robots.
3. Explain to students that a collision avoidance robot is a robot that can avoid obstacles. It does this by using a sensor to detect objects in its path.
4. Show students how the collision avoidance robot works. Have them observe what happens when the robot detects an obstacle.
5. Explain to students that the sensor in the robot uses a time-of-flight distance sensor to detect objects. The sensor sends out a beam of light and measures how long it takes for the beam to return.
6. Have students create their own collision avoidance robot. They can do this by using a variety of materials, such as cardboard, wood, and plastic.
7. Have students test their robots to see how well they can avoid obstacles.
8. Conclude the lesson by asking students to summarize what they have learned about collision avoidance robots.

## Assessment:

* Observe students as they participate in the lesson. Are they able to answer questions about collision avoidance robots? Are they able to follow directions?
* Have students complete a worksheet or quiz on collision avoidance robots.
* Have students create a poster or presentation about collision avoidance robots.

## Differentiation:

* For students who are struggling, provide them with more support. For example, you can provide them with more examples and visuals.
* For students who are ahead, challenge them by asking them more complex questions or having them complete more challenging activities.

## Extension Activities:

* Have students research different types of collision avoidance robots.
* Have students build a more complex collision avoidance robot.
* Have students program a collision avoidance robot to perform a specific task.
