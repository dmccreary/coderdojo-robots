These labs can be used by a wide variety of Arduino kits.  The kits should have two DC hobby motors and a motor controller such as the L293C controller that allows you to control a motor with a PWM signal.

For many CoderDojo projects we have designed a low cost robot that is described next.

## $25 Robot Platform for Teaching Programming
This robot is built around a standard "Smart Car" chassis that you can get on eBay for around $12.  It also contains a low-cost motor controller, an Arduino Nano, a ping sensor and a breadboard that allows you to expand the kit in many different ways.

The assembly of the robot is documented [here](https://www.instructables.com/id/Collision-Avoidance-Robot-for-Teaching-Programming/)
