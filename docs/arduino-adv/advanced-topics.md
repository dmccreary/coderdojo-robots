## PDI controllers
Our base robot may not drive in a straight line.  This is because the motors may move slightly differently although they get the same power.  The way we can control this is by using servo motors or adding motor position monitoring using
Proportional, Derivative, Integral PDI feedback systems.  See
[PDI Controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller)
## servos
We could replace our DC motors with servo motors. Although they are much more expensive, we can control the wheel rotation more precisely.
## other sensors
IR sensors
Line following sensors
## remote control
We can also add a low-cost Bluetooth remote contol system.

## power options
More battery power can also be added.  Some users find that adding two additional batteries allows the robots more power.
