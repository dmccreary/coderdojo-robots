# Collision Avoidance LED Status

Take the collision avoidance lab and when it senses and object in front of it, make it drive in reverse for a second
before it randomly turns.  Update the LED colors to show the state of the car:

1. Green - driving forward with nothing in front of the robot.
2. Red - Sense an object in front of the robot
3. Yellow - Driving in reverse
4. Purple - randomly turning
