== Instructor's Guide for mBots ==
# Try not to drop the robots or step on them
# Warn the students that it is easy to drive off the tables
# All labs that use the motors should be done on the floor

There are several concepts that we want to teach
# The mBot default programs
## remote, collision avoidance, line following - Note: no PC is needed for these modes.  Just the mBots and batteries!  Each box has a figure 8 course.  If we have a white table-top you can put down black tape
# Connecting mobile devices to your PC
## we use the 2.4GHz dongle and the green light must be on
# event-based programs
## attach a function to a key on the keyboard
# continuous loops
## programs that run forever
# reading a sensor
## we used the ultrasonic sensor on the front of the mBot
# comparing values
## we compare the distance to a fixed number to change the robot's behavior
# variables
## use a variable to hold the blinking state and delay time
# subroutines
## create a set of functions for driving (forward, turn-right, turn-left etc.)

Some teaching strategies
# try to keep the initial labs simple
# introduce one simple concept at a time
# constantly ask the students for their own ideas of what they want to change.  Younger kids want to change colors.  Repetition helps them learn and remember.
# try to keep the robots on the desk using the LED labs to start.  Keep the motor labs for later in the session
# Avoid the sound labs if the room is too noisy


Here are some "mBot" challenges:

# Make the LED on the top of the mBot turn red when you hit the spacebar and off when you hit the "o" key
# Make the LED blink continuously using the forever loop - change the speed of the blinking
# Make the the color change when you move your hand closer to the mbot
# Bind the forward, back, left and right to the arrow keys
# Make the robot drive a single square
# Make the robot dance - pick a random direction to turn and a random distance to move
# Make the robot go forward unless there is an object in front.  Then turn. (Collision avoidance)
