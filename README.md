# Welcome to the CoderDojo Robot Documentation

Welcome to the CoderDojo Robot book.  This book allows CoderDojo mentors to teach the concepts of Computer Science using a low-cost Arduino kit.

## About This Book
This book was written by a group of CoderDojo mentors that wanted to keep students interested in Computer Science and Physical Computing.

## Hardware
Our hardware is based an Arduino Nano that can be purchased on-line for under $5.

## Software
We use the standard Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and a variation of the C programming language.

## Building Your Own Robot
This book also has a guide to help you build your own robot based on open standards and parts.
