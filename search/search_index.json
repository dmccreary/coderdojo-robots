This book is about the use of Arduino robots in teaching computer science topics within the CoderDojo system. Our robots are designed around low-cost components that can be purchased for under $30.00. This guide is designed for both mentors and students. We assume the reader has some experience with Arduino programming including using the Arduino development tools to upload programs into the Arduino. The CoderDojo teaching system is designed around two hour blocks of time where students and mentors come together to learn about topics in software. These robots are specifically designed to teach computer science concepts to students ages 10 to 16 using a hands-on approach guided by mentors. For these robot labs we have decided to build upon the existing Arduino system. Many of our mentors and students have already been exposed to Arduinos and are already comfortable downloading and debugging these programs. Although these robots are used fully assembled in our classrooms, we encourage people to purchase the parts online and build their own robots at home or at school. A full itemized list of parts is provided in the next chapter. Acknowledgements We would like to thank everyone in the CoderDojo program, and the mentors and students that have helped us debug our labs. These efforts would not be possible without the help from Matt Gray and Rebecca Schatz who lead the CoderDojo program in the Twin Cities. We also want to thank others that have provided feedback including Eric Palmer, George Sieverts, Gerd Knops and Doug Thorpe.

Note that the links that this article provides might change, however you should be able to find similar parts using the keywords provided. Now lets step through each of our individual components. Arduino compatible Nano This low-cost microcontoller component is the \"brains\" of our robot. Some of these can be ordered with a USB connector so we can connect them directly to our laptop or desktop computer. We can purchase these for under $5.00. The Nano has eight Analog inputs and 14 Digital input/output pins, six of them can be used to control motor speed with PWM signals. Note that ONLY pings 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, and 11 have PWM output. We will be using Digital Output pins 3,5,6 and 9 in our book. Make sure you read our Getting Started section to properly load the CH340 USB interface. See Arduino Nano Specication for the full specification. 2 DC Motors and Wheels We have decided to use simple Direct Current (DC) motors for our robots. These motors are low cost and work under a variety of voltages from 6 to 12 volts. They come included with our Robot Chassis. L293D Two Motor Controller This part allows us to send signals to each motor to turn the wheels forward and backwards. It has a set of screw terminals to connect the motors and power. This board also has a voltage regulator that will convert voltages from 6 to 12 volts down to 5 volts for controlling our Arduino Nano. This part allow us to drive two motors. See the Wikipedia page for more on how the H-Bridge circuit works. You can use the keywords \"Mini Motor Drive Shield Expansion Board L293D Module For Arduino\" to find your own parts. There are many good on-line tutorials on how these parts work. One example is here . These devices can be found for $1.54 (including shipping) when ordered on e-bay. Ultrasonic Distance Sensor We will use low-cost HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensors for our robot. They send out a set of ultrasonic pulse waves out of one speaker and listen for the pulse to return to a microphone. The delay of the return signal corresponds to a distance of an object in front of the robot. They can be purchased for around a dollar on e-bay. We will also use a powerful library to convert the signals into distance measurements. New Ping Solderless Breadboards The robot kit comes with two solderless breadboards, One has 400 connection points and the other smaller board for the sensors has 170 connection points.","title":"Components"},{"location":"arduino/00-components/#arduino-compatible-nano","text":"This low-cost microcontoller component is the \"brains\" of our robot.

These lessons are ideal for students that have already mastered basic keyboarding. If you have pre-keyboarding students we suggest using the mBot. Once the students have mastered the labs in this cirriculum they will revieve an Arduino Robots badge. After they complete these labs they are ready to move on to the advanced arduino robot labs that add a $18 OLED dispay. Classroom Setup Our classrooms typically have Arduino robots connected to USB cables that are connected to PCs (Windoes, Mac and Linux). We require that the Arduino and device drivers to be pre installed on the laptops with a person that have adminstrative rights. Some of the CoderDojo programs allow students to bring their own parts in and the students assemble and program them in the classrooms. Other programs provide full-assembled $25 robots. We find students become more engagued when they purchase and assemble their own robots. Order of Labs We start out with the basics of verifying that the student can communicate from their desktop to the Arduino. This ideally should be tested before students arrive. Making sure that the Arduino IDE is installed and all the communications are working can be the most stressful part of these labs. Once the communications are working the fun begins! Basic Motor Labs We start out with basic motor control. We use low-cost motor driver components that are easy to program using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) output of the Arduinos. The first step is to make the motor turn on and off. Next we make a single motor go forward and backward. Then we work with two motors to go forward and turn. Ping Labs Our robots all have a ultrasonic distance senor on the front. These are also call Ping sensors. They measure the distance in front of a robot and we use them to determine if a robot is about to collide with an object in front of it. Collision Avoidences Once the students know how to control the motors and measure the distance in front of the robot they are ready to create various collision avoidance programs. The first one is simple. It just make the robot turn right if there is an object in front of it. The next once are more sophisticated. They will backup and turn in random directions.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"arduino/00-intro/#introduction-to-basic-arduino-robots","text":"In these lessions plans we will learn some basic principals of computer science using a low cost $25 Arduion robot.

You can get the specification on this board here from the Deek Robot site: http://www.deek-robot.com/productShow.asp?id=17 Here are some key points: * The input voltage can vary from DC4.5-25V * The maximum current is 600mA per motor (1.2A peak). This is well above what 4 AA batteries will use with our DC motors. In practice a full speed motor will draw about 150mA. * There are small red LEDs on the board that indicate if there is a PWM signal being received to the board. You can used this in your debugging. If the motor is not turning, but the red LED is on, it indicates the wires from the board to the motor may not be connected or their is a problem with the motor. If the red LEDs are not lighting up then the may not be a PWM signal getting to the board. * You can enable and disable motors * The chips have overterperatures sensors so the will shut off if they get too hot We will then write a program that will test to see if we got each of the four wires connected from the motor controller to the correct pins on the Arduino. Here is the wiring diagram for our robot: Note that the motors are hooked up to the green \"screw header\" shown at the top of the diagram. * The power from your battery is connected to GND (black wire) and VIN (red wire) * One motor is hooked to the A- and A+ * The other motor is hooked to the B- and B+ The male pins that are at the bottom of the board labeled labeled MCU I/O are on the lower side. These will be labeled IN1, IN2, IN3 and IN4. IN1 and IN2 should get the PWM signals from the Arduino. Only one of the two should get a signal at any time. One will be for forward and one for reverse. Some systems turn both of PWMs on for \"break\", however this uses extra power. Note that the red and black connections here will go to the red and black (or blue) rails of your breadboard. From the rails you will connect power to your Arduino Nano. /* Robot Motors Direction Tests This test makes sure we get all four of the motor dirction pins correct Keep changing these numbers until you get it right directions for each wheel Use the serial monitor to verify which one should be working Note , On the Arduino Nano , only pins 3 , 5 , 6 , 9 , 10 and 11 have PWM output .

Keep the motor labs for later in the session Avoid the sound labs if the room is too noisy Here are some \"mBot\" challenges: Make the LED on the top of the mBot turn red when you hit the spacebar and off when you hit the \"o\" key Make the LED blink continuously using the forever loop - change the speed of the blinking Make the the color change when you move your hand closer to the mbot Bind the forward, back, left and right to the arrow keys Make the robot drive a single square Make the robot dance - pick a random direction to turn and a random distance to move Make the robot go forward unless there is an object in front.
