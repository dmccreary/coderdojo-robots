# Instructor's Guide

Our goal is to teach some of the following computer science concepts:

1. **Physical Computing - **we teach students how to read sensors, do transformations and control the world around them.
2. **Using an IDE** - Setup and install the Arduino Integrated Development Environment to edit, compile, debug and upload your programs to an Arduino computer. This includes the tricky process of installing Arduino drivers.
3. **Uploading **- loading a program from your IDE to an Arduino
4. **Parts of a program** - Libraries, includes, global variables, 
5. **Installing libraries **- How to find and install Arduino libraries and how to get around problems when the libraries don't work together
6. **Preamble **- What to put at the top of your Arduino program before you run your setup program
7. **The setup\(\) function** - The initialization function that gets run only once when your program first starts up
8. **The main loop\(\)** - The function that keeps running until your program is reset or powers down
9. **Variables **- How to named locations in your program's memory and how to use them
10. **Reading data** from sensors - how to read the values from the outside world
11. **Transforming data** - using the map\(\) and constrain\(\) functions to get your variables ready for output
12. **The H-Bridge** - changing motor direction
13. **Transistors and motor controllers** - which is right for your project
14. **Changing motor speed** - how to change motor speed using pulse wave modulation \(PWM\)
15. The motor speed lab
16. The H-Bridge
17. Motor Direction Lab
18. Collision avoidance
19.
